# Brave Heart game
Here is my semestral project - game written in python in BI-PYT 2022/2023.

## How to run the game
My game can be run on any Linux distributive or on a macOS system. To start, you need to go to the **game/** folder, 
since the program modules are looking for a relative path from this directory. After that, use the command to run 
**main.py** of the file.
```
cd game
python3 main.py
```
